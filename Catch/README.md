# Catch

Catch is a game where a ball falls and the user tries to catch it.
I've attempted to implement a Q-learning algorithm that uses function approximation 
User controls:

a = move player left

d = move player right


The title screen.  Where users can choose between a human controlled player or an AI controlled player
